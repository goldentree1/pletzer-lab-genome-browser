- (Sam minor) SHIFT-scrolling for left right scroll.
    1. Ummm idk aye, this might actually be quite hard.
    2. Actually, theres probably some way to move JBrowse left/right.
        So when:
         - shift clicked
         - mouse inside JBrowse window,

- build on macOS (+lock versions)

- Variants as optional in build.sh + program? (didnt sound like the cared much)
    1. Change build script to detect 'variants.vcf'
    2. vcf-rm-empty-metadata-for-jbrowse < variants.vcf > variants.jbrowse-compat.vcf
    3. if vcfFile: add 'vcfFile' to generated config.json, and edit jbrowse-custom.ts to load them.

- get the tests back in, they in that other repo for Daniel

- Re-deploy on Daniel's website.

- Make 'Genome Browser' an actual page on Daniel's website.
