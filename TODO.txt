(IMPORTANT, aka what Daniel/Sam want):
X GET SEARCH WORKING AGAIN! (aliases too for old_locus_tag= names??)
- Script to rebuild based on pre-defined dir structure.
- Ask about using bamCoverage vs bamAverage? Im no longer using bamAverage, and instead
  just merged bigwigs into one .merged.bw file and then used bamCoverage on THAT. MAKE SURE
  it does same thing ... testing.
- Do BAM -> BW for S.Aureus (sam gave me more BAM files)
- "Use Binsizes of 10. CPM Normalization is good, it should be the default" -- Sam.
- Make multi-chromosome stuff display ALL chroms!!!! Actually, Sam doesnt necessarily want that he said. one at a time fine and good, or just some nice easy UI i think is fine. Said its fine as is also - because search can be used to change chromosome we are on (but think he was annoyed it didnt align with refseq - ie each chrom is indexed from 0... should at least fix that, perhaps by programming logic to read .fai and jump forward to relevant index for defaultSession.views)
- WordPress deployment (either static plugin or redirect to Vercel or something):
	Plan:: https://chatgpt.com/c/69698a86-b490-8324-8ec5-9144cc671191
	We can just upload the ENTIRE directory to the 'Wordpress uploads' dir.
	After that, we can just make a simple page that points an iframe to the dir, eg /genome-browser -> /wp-content/uploads/pletzerlab-genome-browser/index.html

(me):
- Tests! Sam seems happy enough that it works after visually inspecting though. BUT
    -- test the scripts work by using VERY simple BAM files with a few coords only
    -- simple averaging check (2+3+1)/3 = 2, for example.
    -- CPM normalise (formula == value/(n_reads/1000000)) (because counts per million, so div million)
    -- Get Sam to check again when happy (the PA14 stuff was good and btw, diff conditions to Weizmann)
- do quick test in fresh VM to make sure easily-reproducible environment of packages (think they use ubuntu server or something in microbiology for bioinformatics stuff)

(minor):
- Sam counts from FAA file displayed.
- Change name to old_locus_tag (minor)
- Some UI thing to change chromosome?? (minor, sam can already search for them)
