(IMPORTANT, aka what Daniel/Sam want):
X GET SEARCH WORKING AGAIN!
X Search aliases via old_locus_tag
X Script to rebuild based on pre-defined dir structure
X "Use Binsizes of 10. CPM Normalization is good, it should be the default" - Sam.
X Do BAM -> BW for S.Aureus (sam gave me more BAM files)
X Wordpress available via WP File Manager

UI fixes/touchups:
- loc string... keep it same on condition changes / gene label changes / normalisation? Alternatively, could keep big
map of all genomes and where the person was at
- secondary label for anything else (default to note)
- make steezy

Bugfix:
 - build.sh:

Ask Daniel:
- whether he wants page or just to link to it
ASK SAM:
- S.aureus USA300 reads only have one chromosome, but there are 4 in reference sequence?
- Multichromosome: is it issue they dont align with refseq? Could:
    A. Do nothing. (when you search, it comes up with chromosomes)
    B. read .fai, save to json, show all?
    C.
- Do we want variants.vcf? Gene counts.faa? Easy to add.
- Should gene labels be changeable? They are searchable by all tags now (old_locus,locus,name) + changeable
- Secondary label for genes to show... do you want notes? Or scrap changeable and just do name/old_locus_tag combo?

(me):
- Tests! Sam seems happy enough that it works after visually inspecting though. BUT
    X test the scripts work by using VERY simple BAM files with a few coords only
    - simple averaging check (2+3+1)/3 = 2, for example.
    - CPM normalise (formula == value/(n_reads/1000000)) (because counts per million, so  value/1,000,000)
    - formal test with Jest or something (check CPM normalize + simple average, though i have informally checked and its fine, PS CPM == counts per million == value/(n_reads/1000000))
X do quick test in fresh VM to make sure easily-reproducible environment of packages (think they use ubuntu server or something in microbiology for bioinformatics stuff)

(minor):
- Some UI thing to change chromosome?? (minor, sam can already search for them)
