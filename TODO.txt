(IMPORTANT, aka what Daniel/Sam want):
X GET SEARCH WORKING AGAIN!
X Search aliases via old_locus_tag
X Script to rebuild based on pre-defined dir structure
X "Use Binsizes of 10. CPM Normalization is good, it should be the default" - Sam.
X Do BAM -> BW for S.Aureus (sam gave me more BAM files)
X Wordpress available via WP File Manager
- ASK SAM: S.aureus USA300 reads only have one chromosome, but there are 4 in reference sequence?
- do better test-case for averaging bigwigs (test build test-build.sh)
- Make multi-chromosome stuff display ALL chroms!!!! Actually, Sam doesnt necessarily want that he said. one at a time fine and good, or just some nice easy UI i think is fine. Said its fine as is also because search can be used to change chromosome we are on (but think he was annoyed it didnt align with refseq - ie each chrom is indexed from 0... should at least fix that, perhaps by programming logic to read .fai and jump forward to relevant index for defaultSession.views)
- Ask Daniel whether he wants page or just to link to it

(me):
- Tests! Sam seems happy enough that it works after visually inspecting though. BUT
    X test the scripts work by using VERY simple BAM files with a few coords only
    - simple averaging check (2+3+1)/3 = 2, for example.
    - CPM normalise (formula == value/(n_reads/1000000)) (because counts per million, so  value/1,000,000)
X do quick test in fresh VM to make sure easily-reproducible environment of packages (think they use ubuntu server or something in microbiology for bioinformatics stuff)

(minor):
- change UI better for CPM-normalise? (minor)
- Sam counts from FAA file displayed (minor)
- Change name to old_locus_tag (minor)
- Some UI thing to change chromosome?? (minor, sam can already search for them)
