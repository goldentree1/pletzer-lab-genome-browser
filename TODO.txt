(20/01):
X GET SEARCH WORKING AGAIN!
X Search aliases via old_locus_tag
X Script to rebuild based on pre-defined dir structure
X "Use Binsizes of 10. CPM Normalization is good, it should be the default" - Sam.
X Do BAM -> BW for S.Aureus (sam gave me more BAM files)
X Wordpress available via WP File Manager
X loc string... keep it same on condition changes / gene label changes / normalisation? Alternatively, could keep big
map of all genomes and where the person was at
X secondary label for anything else (default to note). NO - fine as is.

(30/01):
X S.aureus USA300 reads only have one chromosome, but there are 4 in reference sequence? THIS IS FINE
X Multichromosome: is it issue they dont align with refseq? Could: NO THEY ARE FINE
    A. Do nothing. (when you search, it comes up with chromosomes)
    B. read .fai, save to json, show all?
    C. Select thing at top?
X Should gene labels be changeable? They are searchable by all tags now (old_locus,locus,name) + changeable. DONE
X Secondary label for genes to show... do you want notes? Or scrap changeable and just do name/old_locus_tag combo? NO.

TODO
X EXPERIMENTS Select:: Genome -> experiment -> conditions. So nested dir. Change build.sh and change
    (MAJOR: DO FIRST)
    1. Add combobox for experiment.
    2. Change build script to use <genome_name>/experiments/<experiment_name>/<condition_name>/*.bam
    3.

- (Sam) info.txt as optional in build.sh (info.txt should be an 'info' button on top bar - and should show a popup with literally just whatever text was thrown in). should be a 'info' button, that gives text about the EXPERIMENT.
    X. Change build script to detect experiments/<experiment_name>/'info.txt'
    X. if infoFile: add 'infoFile' to generated config.json for that /experiments/<experiment_name>/
    3. edit jbrowse-custom.ts to load them.
    4. (i) <- that is an 'info' button. it should show the text for the current experiment (if info.txt file exists).

- (Daniel/Sam) Deploy on Daniel site w/ navbar  + footer incl! Sam thinks this would be great.
    (test locally via WP Local first, then do it on Daniel's site)
    1. Setup new page on WordPress
    2. Remove everything except for header/footer.
    3. iframe my site into it
    4. Adjust my site for iframe + Daniel's site.

- (Sam minor) compare >= 3 conditions. Perhaps just a + button if > 3.
    1. Just as is - except theres a check for >=3 conditions: if so, add a (+) button.
    1.1 Or... there could just ALWAYS be + button??
    2. idk how to do this... will be annoying... cuz currently we have conditionA and conditionB as separated vars.

- (Sam minor) SHIFT-scrolling for left right scroll.
    1. Ummm idk aye, this might actually be quite hard.
    2. Actually, theres probably some way to move JBrowse left/right.
        So when:
         - shift clicked
         - mouse inside JBrowse window,
         -

- Variants as optional in build.sh
    1. Change build script to detect 'variants.vcf'
    2. vcf-rm-empty-metadata-for-jbrowse < variants.vcf > variants.jbrowse-compat.vcf
    3. if vcfFile: add 'vcfFile' to generated config.json, and edit jbrowse-custom.ts to load them.

- (minor) build.sh improvements - make it pick up whether old_locus_tag and locus_tag EXIST before adding options

- (minor) build.sh improvements - BAMCOV_NORMALISATIONS = "cpm,none" should actually do stuff...

- (minor) make steezier:
    1. hovering normalisation OR gene labels should give 'title' popup (perhaps indicating eg in case of normalisation, that eg CPM = Counts Per Million)

- (minor) more basic tests + fix build test (eg CPM test, mean test)

- (very minor) GTF files accepted as well as GFF.

- (very minor) accept FASTA, FA, FNA, FAA extensions for refseq.fasta
