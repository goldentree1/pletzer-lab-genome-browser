X (Daniel/Sam) Deploy on Daniel site w/ navbar  + footer incl! Sam thinks this would be great.
    (test locally via WP Local first, then do it on Daniel's site)
    1. Setup new page on WordPress
    2. Remove everything except for header/footer.
    3. iframe my site into it
    4. Adjust my site for iframe + Daniel's site.

X (Sam minor) compare >= 3 conditions. Perhaps just a + button if > 3.
    1. Just as is - except theres a check for >=3 conditions: if so, add a (+) button.
    1.1 Or... there could just ALWAYS be + button??
    2. idk how to do this... will be annoying... cuz currently we have conditionA and conditionB as separated vars.

- (Sam minor) SHIFT-scrolling for left right scroll.
    1. Ummm idk aye, this might actually be quite hard.
    2. Actually, theres probably some way to move JBrowse left/right.
        So when:
         - shift clicked
         - mouse inside JBrowse window,

- Variants as optional in build.sh + program? (didnt sound like the cared much)
    1. Change build script to detect 'variants.vcf'
    2. vcf-rm-empty-metadata-for-jbrowse < variants.vcf > variants.jbrowse-compat.vcf
    3. if vcfFile: add 'vcfFile' to generated config.json, and edit jbrowse-custom.ts to load them.

- get the tests back in, they in that other repo for Daniel

- Need titles for the selects (Genome, experiment etc) for Daniel

X MAJOR CACHE ISSUE:  const experiments = Object.keys(myConf[genome].data.experiments);
If that fails, entire site wont load. We need to detect if that conf is gone, and if it is gone, reset
localStorage to use just first genome/conf.

- Proper overflow:scroll; for condition-selects

- Re-deploy on Daniel's website.

- Make 'Genome Browser' an actual page on Daniel's website.

- Stylistic bugfix: no hover popups on selects once they were opened

- Make sure README / REPORT is good.

- (minor) Style the info popup better (just so it looks like JBrowse - GPT should be able to)

- (minor) Style the +, i and x buttons better

- (minor) Do a final re-arrange w/ CSS:
(EG see ./thoguht)

- (minor) shift+mousewheel = horizontal scroll for Sam

- (minor) build.sh improvements - make it pick up whether old_locus_tag and locus_tag EXIST before adding options

- (minor) build.sh improvements - BAMCOV_NORMALISATIONS = "cpm,none" should actually do stuff...
