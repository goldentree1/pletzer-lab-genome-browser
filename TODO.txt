TODO:

-- Multi-conditions display
X Make individual replicates able to be shown
X Compute averages script (per-base, so no binning to start with)
X Compare
X statefulness (remembers checkbox settings between loads, uses React to keep log-scaling between genome switches, etc.)
X STATEFULNESS: make same genome/comparison come up
X responsivity

IMPORTANT (what Sam wants):
X GET SEARCH WORKING AGAIN! (aliases too for old_locus_tag= names??)
- Do BAM -> BW for S.Aureus (sam gave me more BAM files)
- "Use Binsizes of 10. CPM Normalization is good, it should be the default" -- Sam.
- Script to rebuild based on pre-defined dir structure.
- Make multi-chromosome stuff display ALL chroms!!!! (bugfix)
- WordPress deployment (either static plugin or redirect to Vercel or something):
	Plan:: https://chatgpt.com/c/69698a86-b490-8324-8ec5-9144cc671191
	We can just upload the ENTIRE directory to the 'Wordpress uploads' dir.
	After that, we can just make a simple page that points an iframe to the dir, eg /genome-browser -> /wp-content/uploads/pletzerlab-genome-browser/index.html
-

- Make JBrowse custom better by making it a class?
- Make JBrowse custom better by removing need for 'rnaseq' or whatever?
- Switch between side-by-side / overlay
- Sam counts from FAA file displayed.
- Change name to old_locus_tag (AND/OR use aliases for search)
- Testing:  we can test the scripts work by using VERY simple BAM files with a few coords only (learn how that works),
and very simple bigwig files to test averages, etc!
X Testing: compare to Weizmann data. Then once visually ok looking, we can use that dataset seeing how to test. DW! Weizmann is different conditions to our PA14. SAM had a look at what I've done - and thinks its displaying well etc.

=== get all regions to display for (currently only first one does grr):
			- public/data/GCF_000013465.1
			- public/data/GCF_000281535.2
			- public/data/GCF_031932345.1

	^^NO - THIS IS FINE. MAYBE  SOME UI THING TO SWITCH CHROMOSOMES OR AT LEAST
	JUST SHOW THAT THEY EXIST. OR MAYBE INCL. ALL IF THEY DONT TAKE UP FULL SPACE

=== deploy... on fucking WORDPRESS :O (either WP redirect, or maybe static plugin)

=== check all searches work
            - aliases too - like old_locus_tag (minor)

=== PLES name change / old_locus_tag=

X log scale - make base-10 log manually (looks like its base-2 in jbrowse w/ no way to change)?
WE DONT NEED BASE-10, BASE-2 is FINE.

=== file upload?? (minor)
Dont think so - we are just going to make it REBUILD-ABLE!!
That way, postdocs / professor can simply re-deploy it.

=== FAA gene counts (minor)
