TODO

BEFORE THURS HAND-IN:
- build on macOS (+lock versions)
- get the tests back in, they in that other repo for Daniel
- finish report.md (add to README.md)
- anyhting we missed in README.md?
- presentation!!! :-O
- (minor) Variants as optional in build.sh + program? (didnt sound like the cared much)
    1. Change build script to detect 'variants.vcf'
    2. vcf-rm-empty-metadata-for-jbrowse < variants.vcf > variants.jbrowse-compat.vcf
    3. if vcfFile: add 'vcfFile' to generated config.json, and edit jbrowse-custom.ts to load them.
